**Project Background:**

Indonesia, as a tropical country, faces a high prevalence of skin diseases, with rates reaching 4.60%–12.95%, ranking third among the nation's most common diseases (Desmawati, 2020). Despite the urgency, access to dermatologists remains limited, especially in remote areas, delaying diagnosis and treatment. Privacy concerns during examinations further complicate the situation. To address these challenges, we propose an AI-based application enabling users to detect skin diseases through uploaded photos. This app provides early diagnosis and treatment recommendations, ensuring quicker, safer, and more private healthcare access.

**Mobile Development:** 

The Derma Aid project was developed as a mobile application designed to meet users' needs in diagnosing skin diseases quickly, safely, and efficiently. The application was built using Android Studio, leveraging more than 55 libraries to support various advanced features and enhance its performance. To create an intuitive and user-friendly interface, the application was designed using Figma, while GitHub served as the main platform for team collaboration and centralized project file storage. The Derma Aid application includes several key features tailored to make it more convenient for users, such as a news menu integrated with an API to display the latest health information, an image upload feature that allows users to safely upload skin photos for detection, and a history menu to track past diagnoses and monitor skin condition progress. Additionally, the application provides a profile menu for managing user data and a home menu as the main navigation hub to access all features. To ensure an optimal user experience, the application uses Firebase for real-time connectivity and is equipped with a data buffer mechanism, allowing it to function seamlessly even without an internet connection. With a comprehensive technological approach, Derma Aid stands out as a modern, inclusive, and effective health application innovation.
